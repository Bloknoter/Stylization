# Stylization
This tool can save you time while working on GUI. The idea is that with the help of this tool you can create different styles for different GUI 
elements (list of supported elements is in README file). And you can update this styles from one place, so every element that follows this 
style will update itself. It's really usefull if you have a giant amount of GUI elements and you are tired to change style of numerous buttons 
and sliders  because designers thought  that "it would look in another way"))) 

Supported types:
Button,
Image,
Text (Legacy and TextMeshPro),
Slider,
Toggle,

New types and features will be soon...
